        <p class="information">A period is the part of the menstrual cycle when a woman bleeds from her vagina for a few days.
            For most women this happens every 28 days or so, but it's common for periods to be more or less frequent
            than this, ranging from day 21 to day 40 of their menstrual cycle.
            “Period” is rooted in the Greek words “peri” and “hodos” (periodos) meaning “around” and “way/path.”
            This eventually turned into the Latin “periodus” meaning “recurring cycle.”
            Use of the English term “period” to describe menstruation began in the early 1800s (1).
            The menses phase: This phase, which typically lasts from day one to day five, is the time when the lining of
            the uterus isactually shed out through the vagina if pregnancy has not occurred. Most women bleed
            for three to five days, but a period lasting only two days to as many as
            seven days is still considered normal</p>
