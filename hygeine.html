        <p class="information">Menstrual Hygiene is vital to the empowerment and well-being of women and girls worldwide.
            It is about more than just access to sanitary pads and appropriate toilets â€“ though those are important.
            It is also about ensuring women and girls live in an environment that values and supports their ability
            to manage their menstruation with dignity.</p>
